<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>I am in my final semester of Bachelor of Applied Science (Psychology). I am Chinese by ethnicity and was born in Malaysia then moved to Singapore when I was 11. I enjoy reading, going to the gym and cooking in my free time. I have no IT experience. I think there's always added value when you learn new things, especially outside of your usual area of expertise. As I am studying psychology, we don't learn anything IT related. I can definitely see the value of IT in terms of creating a mental health app, or even my own website for clinical practice and even how psychology can inform IT in terms of personalization in user experience.</p>
<h4>Personality Tests</h4>
<p>hese test results could help the group understand how and why I go about things a certain way, which would reduce misunderstandings. It also increases efficiency as everyone in the group understands each other's learning styles and personalities.
