<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>I am an IT beginner who is in her second year at RMIT, which means that I still have a lot of things to learn in IT. My given name is ShuyunLi and I am Chinese. Due to Covid, 2021 is also my second year in China doing online classes. Therefore, I am looking forward to coming back to the RMIT campus. I graduated from Elwood college, my main research was on language, I studied Japanese for 2 years when I was in high school. I enjoy music, cooking, pc games and love to meet new friends. I have a pet dog, named Zhuanzhuan.
 While preparing for my college entrance examination, I developed an interest in IT through my math teacher who is a graduate of the IT program. I am drawn to IT as it is a high-paying profession. More importantly, the IT industry covers a wide range of jobs in various industries.
 I chose RMIT because my agent told me that RMIT has a long history and has an excellent IT teaching team and program. I wanted to challenge myself by studying something new, so I chose RMIT’s IT program. Also, the city campus is near my apartment. I hope I can learn more about IT through my degree at RMIT.

<h4>Personality Tests</h4>
<p>My disadvantage is excessive perfectionism, accepting only the superficial phenomena of things and ignoring the possibility of deeper meaning, difficulty to make decisions, difficulty making long-term plans and a lack of social skills.
</p>
<p>My advantages are the capacity for empathy and compassion, ISFP’s are good at being listeners and imitating. I am always enthusiastic, loyal, attentive to details, (especially those related to others), thoughtful, knowing what is required of me and a good team player, careful analysis of risks and an open mind to consider multiple solutions.
