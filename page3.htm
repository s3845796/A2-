<h3>Members</h3>
<p>Our team is a ragtag international group of people from various countries.</p>
<p>Nayli, the creative free spirit who likes to crochet and learn to skateboard in her spare time. She enjoys all things horror and cannot get enough of it. She likes making floral arrangements and bouquets and spends too much time rewatching the same sitcom over and over again.</p>
<p>Melanie, the brains, she is currently in her final year of Psychology (applied sciences). She has taken a break from all the psychological mumbo jumbo to take up an IT elective to join us in Introduction to IT for some creative freedom and fun.
</p>
<p>Julie, the quiet, mysterious one. She is a shy one with not much to say but you can bet that she is brimming with ideas and suggestions to further boost our projects as they come.</p>
<p>Yu-Cheng (Jacky), the lovable goofball who is always down to hang out, you will find him out and about with friends or travelling to wherever his heart desires (Travel pending due to COVID).</p>
<p>And then thereâ€™s Kelvin, an introverted recluse (94% introversion according to the 16 Personalities test!!) who fancies his spare time playing video games and spending time with his missus. He is often bogged down in a full schedule of work, university and assignments so does not get too much time to play games anymore. But you best believe that if he finds some spare time he will be playing.</p>
